## About
{: #about}

I am an applied microeconomist whose research bridges environmental, agricultural, and development economics, often drawing upon geospatial and Earth-observation data. I study how producers, firms, and regulators respond to risk and information, with the goal of improving the design of policies and programs for public benefit in both international as well as U.S. contexts. 

Much of my current work centers on agricultural index insurance — how these programs are designed and evaluated as well as how enrollment responds to past weather, realized payouts, and seasonal forecasts. Other active work evaluates the impacts of programs that pay producers to adopt soil and water conservation practices as well as how firms respond to information about regulatory compliance risk. 

Institutionally, I'm an Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech in the [Agricultural and Applied Economics Department](https://aaec.vt.edu). I’m also a faculty affiliate of the [VT Remote Sensing Graduate Education Group](https://rsigep.frec.vt.edu/), the [Global Change Center](https://www.globalchange.vt.edu/), and the [Stanford RegLab](https://reglab.stanford.edu/). I co-lead the Agricultural Insurance & Finance impact area for [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/), a consortium for monitoring global food production with Earth Observations. Previously, I was a postdoc in the [Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR) Innovation Lab](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/) in the Agricultural and Resource Economics department at UC Davis, following my Ph.D. from the [Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources (E-IPER)](https://pangea.stanford.edu/eiper) at Stanford. Before grad school I was a research analyst at [Climate Policy Initiative](https://climatepolicyinitiative.org/), after studying economics and environmental science at UNC-Chapel Hill.
